## What It Is And How It Works

In the current situation, face-to-face learning can be difficult and intimidating for some. Additionally, many people may be hesitant to learn from a teacher due to concerns about cost. However, with the advancement of technology, we can address these issues by using video call technology to facilitate remote learning.

Introducing the Hello Teacher application, which offers learning sessions with various teachers from different subjects. The application enables clients to easily find and select their desired teacher based on ratings, reviews, and session fees. Payment is made easy for clients, and once the teacher's timeslot is purchased, the teacher can set the duration of the session and start the session at the scheduled time. After the session is complete, clients can provide feedback via a review system.

As the service provider, we will take a commission from each transaction that occurs, and the teacher will receive their payment directly from the client. We believe this application will help to make learning more accessible and convenient for clients, as they can easily find a teacher from various subjects. Once you try the Hello Teacher application, we are confident that you will fully understand its functionality.
